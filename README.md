Smart &amp; Sustainable E-Waste Management â€“ Scalable solutions for responsible e-waste disposal

My Colab Link of my model which detects image is a e waste or not https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1OIpFVmSvf9jV1WtH67BlKgWR5BbGde_A#scrollTo=d0ekHdGhnrhj
The above colaboratory is in progress and it checks for epochs

My dataset link of image datasets   https://drive.google.com/file/d/17PlBI7Ol0u91buiRqa1am_OV3JWcrBRH/view?usp=drive_link

My prot.io link and its exported .pdf for sample project how it will be:

Suggestions from Mentor Round 1: We initially use mobilenetv2 pretained model of tensorflow module packages so suggestion from panel is not used pretained models for image classification. So by discussing now we trained our model using cnn by applying its algorithm in our model.
We also do text classification to give suggestion as repair/dispose for that we have made our own dataset I attached it below
[User_Input.csv](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/19777684/User_Input.csv) and below is my colab link that work i had be done till now

Now our task 2 is doing our model trained according to suggestions.
